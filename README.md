## Types of recommender systems
### Collaborative filtering 
leverages the power of community to provide recommendations.
### User-based filtering
The main idea behind user-based filtering is that if we are able to find users that have bought and liked similar items in the past, they are more likely to buy similar items in the future too.
### Item-based filtering
If a group of people have rated two items similarly, then the two items must be similar. Therefore, if a person likes one particular item, they're likely to be interested in the other item too.
### Content-based systems
### Knowledge-based recommenders
### Hybrid recommenders

## The simple recommender
1. Choose a metric (or score) to rate the movies on
2. Decide on the prerequisites for the movie to be featured on the chart
3. Calculate the score for every movie that satisfies the conditions
4. Output the list of movies in decreasing order of their scores
